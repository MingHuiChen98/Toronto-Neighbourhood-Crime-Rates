      <description>Authorship The paper is written by Ming Hui Chen.
 Abstract Criminal rates in a neighborhood are closely associated with public safety. In this paper, we investigate the criminal rates in Toronto by neighborhoods, which is an observational study conducting by Toronto Police Services and released on September 18th, 2020. We found that a hot spot is more likely to have positive growth of criminal rates year by year, while the criminal counts of safer neighborhood are most likely declining.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
