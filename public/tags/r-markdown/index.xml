      <description>Authorship The paper is written by Ming Hui Chen.
 Abstract Criminal rates in a neighborhood are closely associated with public safety. In this paper, we investigate the criminal rates in Toronto by neighborhoods, which is an observational study conducting by Toronto Police Services and released on September 18th, 2020. We found that a hot spot is more likely to have positive growth of criminal rates year by year, while the criminal counts of safer neighborhood are most likely declining.</description>
